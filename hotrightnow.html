    <h2> CELEBRATING NEW YEAR'S IN AUTUMN</h2>

        Fall season is a time for interesting layering, dynamic textures and a richer, warmer color palette.
         F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote in The Great Gatsby that “life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.” 
         Fall has always felt this way to me: a fresh start, even as we are heading toward the end of the year.
          We start fresh in our jobs, schools, maybe even relationships and friendships. 
          It’s like New Year’s because you create new goals, set a positive, different mindset in order to become successful in a 
          field that you’re good at or maybe you decide to start off autumn with trying something new, like a new hobby, new location
           to grab a cup of coffee, or even changing your qualification, who knows.

            This fall, surprise surprise, welcomes you with new fashion trends that you can follow if you want to look fashionable and up-to-date.
             Since fall is known for fashion weeks (there’s one in Copenhagen, if you’re interested) and Halloween parties you will definitely 
             see many ideas and inspiration for your outfits. This year there are many trends that I actually love and will be wearing and
              because of that I’ll let you in to the secrets of this autumn giving you advice on what to wear, how to style this season’s trends
               and where to find clothes and accessories that won’t break your bank.

        <h5> EXPLORE THIS SEASON'S MUST HAVES</h5>

        <article> 
           <p id=third> 
            Eager to explore what the fashion world has to offer, I’ve gathered some of my favorite trends, 
            all of which are totally wearable, easy to incorporate into your existing wardrobe, classic enough to roll around season 
            after season and available at all price points. Here’s to a whole new season of fashion fun! 
           <p>

     <div class="flex-container">
                <h7> COZY SHACKET</h7>
                <p class="shacket"> In summer we wear denim jackets, in fall it’s time to bring out a soft, wool or fleecy shacket that will keep you warm 
                    and also fashionable since it’s a staple piece this season, which goes with anything that you have in your closet such as
                     dresses, boots, leather pants, heels, you name it.</p>
         <div><img src="images/transp.png" alt="shacket" width="40%" height="60%"></div>

                <h8> KNEE-HIGH BOOTS</h8>
                <p class="boots"> Time for some rock n roll, baby! These bad boys will make you look fierce and feel like you own 
                    the whole world. I’m wearing them with a black turtle-neck sweater, plaid skirt and a leather jacket…</p>
                <div><img src="images/boots.png" alt="boots" width="30%" height="50%"></div>

                <h9> COLLARED JUMPER</h9>
                <p class="jumper"> Polo shirt + jumper= COLLARED JUMPER! What more could you ask for. It'll keep your warm but stylish at the same time without
                 needing to put a lot of effort into your outfit. Some jumpers have buttons while some are V-neck and some are fitted while some
                  are loose. Wear it to your friend's birthday paired with a skirt or save it for that special occasion,job interview,perhaps. 
                  Just throw on a blazer to make it more formal and you're good to go.
                 </p>
                <div><img src="images/cardigan.png" alt="cardigan" width="30%" height="50%"></div>  

                <h10> PLEATED MINI SKIRT</h10>
                <p class="skirt"> This piece is extremely versatile and should be in everyone's closet since it can be worn during any season,whether
                     it's pouring rain or when it's sunny. Whether you're someone who enjoys classy style or are down for experimenting with new ways
                      to wear old things, you'll find a ton of looks worth giving try. Cop one of these bad boys right now!
